### RELFECTION
First 4 weeks in GA has taught me very intensively how to use HTML, CSS and Java Script. I would have to say Java script is very similar to python just the syntax is a bit different. Overall, this game really challenged me to understand how to show and hide objects at the timing I wanted it to. I learn alot on OOP and also CSS styling.
